Online ML-based Forecasting Pipeline using AWS,N/A,"This project develops a real estate price forecasting system using time series data. It ingests both live data (e.g., market sentiment, economic indicators) via Lambda and Kinesis, and static data (e.g., historical property sales) into Amazon S3. Data is processed and integrated using AWS Glue, with features like lag variables and rolling averages engineered in SageMaker Data Wrangler. The DeepAR algorithm in SageMaker trains a forecasting model on the processed data, which is periodically retrained to handle data drift. Predictions are deployed via a real-time endpoint exposed through API Gateway, and performance is monitored using SageMaker Model Monitor and CloudWatch. If model accuracy drops, an automatic retraining process is triggered via Lambda.",N/A
US Housing Prices Exploratory Data Analysis and ML model development,"['Jupyter', 'SKLearn', 'Pandas']","This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning model development for predicting US housing prices. The dataset is around 1.5m values scraped from Realtor.com and includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, acre lot, and more. I was able to achieve an RÂ² of 0.83 but plan on implementing more complex features through K-means and gathering job growth/decay and income data.",https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gON2Aoo-aMUfpQ7FHSwQxcabLWxX-ASH?usp=sharing
Employee/Project Management Application,"['MariaDB', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'PHP']","This Employee and Project Management System is a dynamic web application designed to facilitate the management of employees, projects, and resources for a large-scale company. The system supports CRUD operations across various entities and maintains many-to-many relationships between employees, positions, projects, and resources. The application is built using MariaDB for database management, with a responsive web interface for easy interaction.",https://github.com/typedef-mukyu/cs340-course-project?tab=readme-ov-file
Real Estate Data Visualizer,"['Python', 'JavaScript', 'HTML']","This project is a web application for visualizing real estate data. The application provides interactive plots and heatmaps to show the distribution of median home prices across different states and counties. The project includes several microservices for data processing, visualization, and prediction. The main file, app.py, handles the routing and rendering of the visualizations, as well as loading and preprocessing the GeoJSON data. Eventually, I plan to scale this to the entire US when I optimize the loading and visualizer further and integrate this with an ML predictive model. I also plan to make the slider into a continuous motion instead of discrete yearly entries for better visualization.",https://github.com/DOGBALLGNOSIS/REdata_visualizer
Hybridized Multi-Agent UAV Navigation System,"['MATLAB Simulink', 'Kotlin', 'Fusion']","This project focuses on developing a hybridized multi-agent navigation algorithm for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), integrating multiple advanced techniques such as pSLAM (Planar Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree), MCL (Monte Carlo Localization), and R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks). The system is designed to efficiently navigate complex environments while performing real-time object detection using a multi-sensory array, including LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging. This builds upon my previous project, integration of LiDAR and thermal imaging for object detection using CNN's. The core application is search and rescue in disaster zones, where UAVs autonomously map environments, detect victims, and relay critical information to rescuers.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FdvZGM0RP4TZEI057rndcptofR-xBio/view?usp=sharing
